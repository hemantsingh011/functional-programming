# Functional Programming

Example implementations of different concepts of functional programming in Java and Scala.

In object-oriented programming we define classes and then extend them, overloading their methods. In functional programming, we define higher order functions as interfaces and call them with different parameters, resulting in different behaviors.

Functions are first class values, meaning they can be passed around as any other data. The paradigm mainly uses pure functions that don't have side-effects:
 - I/O
 - Exceptions (checked)
 - Global mutable state
